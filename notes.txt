Telnet protocol has a bunch of options and the option negotiation is messy.
By default with no options enabled, Telnet starts in a mode where both sides send a line at a time and the client echoes the line locally.

List of Telnet options: https://www.iana.org/assignments/telnet-options/telnet-options.xhtml

- Linux Netkit Telnet
  - Doesn't try to actively negotiate options if not connected to a 'telnet' port. Use command 'open <host> - <port>' to enable negotiation.

- Putty Telnet
  - Default setting is to always actively negotiate options.
